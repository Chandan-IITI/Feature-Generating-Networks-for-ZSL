# Feature-Generating-Networks-for-ZSL
This repository is an implementation of Feature Generating Networks for Zero Shot Learning (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.00981.pdf) in Tensorflow.

## Pre-Requisites
1. Compatible with Python-3, Tensorflow 1.5
2. Download datasets for zero shot learning from http://datasets.d2.mpi-inf.mpg.de/xian/xlsa17.zip

## Running the code
```
  sh zsl_awa.sh
```
Make sure you provide the correct dataset path in the shell script.
You can change the arguments passed in the shell script to generate results for any dataset.
